# huklbot

Personal bot created in 2020 to pester close friends. Previously hosted on Heroku, but no longer maintained. 
Mainly interacted with my local MySQL server. 

FUNctionalities (ahahha) include:
1) gulag -- option which (assuming the bot is given admin permissions), traps members of lower roles 
into a channel and spams random, painfully wholesome memes from reddit until submission by saying a 
safe word set by an admin.
2) harvest -- option which, admittedly obscure and grotesque, harvest other users for their organs. 
Any member can create a pair of organs which are represented by a name and an emoji. Every user now
has this particular organ, which can be harvested by other members using a harvest command. Essentially
creating an economy reliant on organs and more realistic in the sense that economic gain for one member 
marks the economic loss of the other. Also allows members to view their stats/how many bodies (collected
all organs of a member) they've acquired in relation to others.
3) help -- lists all functionalities of all commands
4) bark -- barks at the user
5) annoy -- given the user is an admin, individually dms EVERY user in the server a given message
